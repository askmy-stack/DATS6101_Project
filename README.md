L.A. Crime Scene Investigation: Data-Driven Detectives

This is an Introduction to Data Science Project From Group-6



# Research Topic: - 
The city of Los Angeles faces ongoing challenges in understanding and addressing the complexity of crime across its diverse neighborhoods. With thousands of recorded incidents varying by crime type, victim demographics, location, and modus operandi, law enforcement and city officials require deeper insights into the patterns and factors driving crime in specific areas.

The dataset includes detailed information on reported crimes such as crime codes, descriptions, victim age, sex, and descent, as well as crime locations, types of weapons used, and case statuses. However, identifying meaningful trends and correlations—such as how crime types vary by location, how victim demographics relate to specific crimes, and how different weapons are used in different crimes—remains a critical challenge.
Focus on Crime Analysis in Los Angeles from 2020 to present using a dataset containing detailed information on crime incidents.

# SMART Question: - 
1. Which area of Los Angeles has experienced the highest increase in Theft, Robbery, and Homicide rates from 2010 to the present, and what factors (e.g., population density, economic conditions) might be contributing to this rise? Provide a year-over-year analysis to identify patterns.
2. How does the distribution of various levels and types of crimes (Theft, Robbery, and Homicide) differ across years of Los Angeles from 2020 to the present, and which has the highest overall crime density? 
3. How can we analyze crime trends across different regions in Los Angeles to uncover high-risk areas for specific crimes (Theft, Robbery, Homicide)?

# Dataset Information: - 
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present
The dataset includes detailed information on reported crimes from 2020 to the present, with approximately 950,000 rows and 28 columns. Key details include:
1. Crime types
2. Locations
3. Dates
4. Demographic data of involved individuals. etc

The dataset includes detailed fields such as crime status (whether the case is open, under investigation, or closed), types of weapons used, and multiple crime codes for incidents involving more than one criminal offense. This allows for deeper analysis of crime severity and resolution rates.

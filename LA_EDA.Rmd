**SMART QUESTIONS**

1) Which neighborhoods in Los Angeles have experienced the most significant increases in crime rates from 2020 to the present, and are these trends consistent for the same types of crimes year over year?
2) How have theft, robbery, and homicide rates in Los Angeles changed from 2020 to the present, and which of these categories shows the highest overall density of crime during this time?
3) How does the type or frequency of crimes in Los Angeles vary by victim descent, and are there significant geographic patterns (based on latitude and longitude) associated with specific victim groups?
4) Which crimes in Los Angeles exhibited the highest weapon usage, and which ethnicities and genders showed the most significant weapon involvement over the last five years?
5) How have the top three most common crimes from 2020 to the present been distributed across the top five areas where they are most frequently committed in Los Angeles, and are these trends increasing or decreasing in each area from 2020 to 2024?


```{r}
crime = read.csv("Crime_Data_from_2020_to_Present.csv")
head(crime)
```

```{r}
nrow(crime)
ncol(crime)
```

The dataset contains 28 columns and 986500 rows.
1) DR_NO - Division of Records Number: Official file number.
2) Date Rptd - MM/DD/YYYY
3) DATE OCC - MM/DD/YYYY
4) TIME OCC - In 24 hour military time
5) AREA - The LAPD has 21 Community Police Stations referred to as Geographic Areas within the department. These Geographic Areas are sequentially numbered from 1-21.

7) Crm Cd - Indicates the crime committed. Crime Code 1 is the primary and most serious one. Crime Code 2, 3, and 4 are respectively less serious offenses. Lower crime class numbers are more serious.
8) Crm Desc - Indicates the crime description
9) Vict Age - Age of victim
10) Vict Sex - 	F : Female M : Male X : Unknown
11) Vict Descent - 	Descent Code: A - Other Asian B - Black C - Chinese D - Cambodian F - Filipino G - Guamanian H - Hispanic/Latin/Mexican I - American Indian/Alaskan Native J - Japanese K - Korean L - Laotian O - Other P - Pacific Islander S - Samoan U - Hawaiian V - Vietnamese W - White X - Unknown Z - Asian Indian
12) Weapon Desc - Defines the Weapon Used Code provided.
13) Location - Street address of crime incident rounded to the nearest hundred block to maintain anonymity.
14) LAT - Latitude
15) LON - Longtitude

Analysis
1) Hand Gun usage is notably higher for Black (B) and Hispanic (H) victims, with males being disproportionately represented. Strong Arm (physical force) incidents are more frequent for White (W) victims, with a balanced representation of both male and female victims.

2) Across all categories, males (teal) are more frequently victims, especially in cases involving firearms.
Female victims (red) appear more frequently in non-weapon-based incidents such as Strong Arm cases (e.g., assaults).

3) Hispanic (H) victims have a high rate of gun-related incidents involving male victims. White (W) victims show a high count for Strong Arm incidents, with females almost matching male victims. Other (O) group mainly experiences incidents involving Strong Arm, with no significant firearm usage.

4) This visualization suggests that firearms are predominantly involved in incidents affecting Black and Hispanic males. Meanwhile, physical force is more common among White victims. Gender-based victimization patterns are also evident, with men more frequently involved in firearm-related incidents, whereas women are more often victims in physical confrontations.

Analysis:

Males:
1) For several ethnic groups, males are involved in the majority of crimes compared to females. Black and Hispanic/Latino/Mexican groups exhibit the highest crime counts, indicated by darker shades.

Females:
1) Crimes against females appear less frequent overall, with relatively lighter shades. However, there is still notable representation among Black and Hispanic/Latino/Mexican victims, though to a lesser extent than males.

Unknown/Other Sex (X):
1) This category has significant counts across several ethnicities, particularly Black, Hispanic/Latino/Mexican, and White groups.     

White victims also show a high frequency but with a more balanced sex distribution compared to other ethnic groups.
Asian and Pacific Islander groups generally exhibit lower crime counts, as indicated by the lighter shades.

The gender distribution also shows that males are disproportionately affected across most ethnic groups, especially in the most impacted categories.

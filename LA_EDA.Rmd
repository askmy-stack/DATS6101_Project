**SMART QUESTIONS**

1) Which area of Los Angeles has experienced the highest increase in Theft, Robbery, and Homicide rates from 2010 to the present, and what factors (e.g., population density, economic conditions) might be contributing to this rise? Provide a year-over-year analysis to identify patterns.
2) How does the distribution of various levels and types of crimes (Theft, Robbery, and Homicide) differ across years of Los Angeles from 2020 to the present, and which has the highest overall crime density?
3) How does the type or frequency of crimes in Los Angeles vary by victim descent, and are there significant geographic patterns (based on latitude and longitude) associated with specific victim groups?
4) Which type of crime in Los Angeles is most frequently associated with weapon use, and what specific types of weapons are most commonly involved in those incidents over the last 2 years?


```{r}
